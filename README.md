# Modeling and Control of a Campus COVID-19 Outbreak

This repository consists of a Python program for the interactive simulation of a [COVID-19 outbreak in a campus-like environment](https://ndsmcobserver.com/2020/03/nd-faculty-discuss-public-health-importance-of-remote-learning-in-flattening-the-curve/) using a standard SEIR epidemiological model.

### Dashboards

The Oxford RSE group is in a collaboration with [HealthMap](https://www.healthmap.org/covid-19) and produced a dashboard of COVID-19 case reports.

Other dashboards cited by the media are:

* [WHO Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Situation](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd)

There are several other dashboards done by smaller groups and individuals that display information in useful ways.
